> **The comprehensive, community-maintained index of Australian AI Security standards, policies, frameworks, and guidance.**

Australia's National AI Plan was released on 2 December 2025. AI Security didn't make the cut.

This repository exists to fill that gap, consolidating every federal and state/territory AI security document into a single, navigable resource. Because if the government won't map AI Security, the community will.

---

## Why This Exists

Australia has **75+ AI-related security documents** spread across 11 jurisdictions, multiple departments, and various regulatory bodies. There is no single source of truth. Practitioners must navigate:

- **Federal**: ACSC, DHA, PSPF, CISC, DTA, DISR, APRA, ASIC, OAIC, eSafety
- **States/Territories**: NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, TAS, NT, ACT
- **Mandatory vs Voluntary**: ISM controls, PSPF directions, sector regulations, voluntary guidance
- **Overlapping frameworks**: Multiple risk assessment approaches, inconsistent terminology, no clear hierarchy

This index provides:

**Complete inventory** of all Australian AI Security documents  
**Relationship mapping** showing how frameworks connect  
**Gap analysis** comparing Australia to international standards  
**Practical navigation** for compliance and implementation  
**Regular updates** as new documents are released

## Quick Navigation

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Complete Inventory](docs/INVENTORY.md) | All 75+ documents in one place |
| [Federal Frameworks](docs/FEDERAL.md) | ACSC, PSPF, ISM, SOCI, DTA, regulators |
| [State & Territory](docs/STATES.md) | NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, TAS, NT, ACT |
| [International Comparison](docs/INTERNATIONAL.md) | Australia vs EU, UK, US, Singapore |
| [Gap Analysis](docs/GAPS.md) | What's missing from Australia's approach |
| [Knowledge Graph](docs/KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md) | Visual map of framework relationships |
| [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | Update history |

## Key Findings

### What Australia Has

- **ISM AI Controls** (ISM-1923, ISM-1924, ISM-2072): Mandatory for government, references OWASP Top 10 for LLM
- **ACSC Five Eyes Guidance**: World-class technical guidance on secure AI deployment, supply chain, data security
- **PSPF AI Provisions**: First AI-specific protective security requirements (2025)
- **State Leaders**: NSW and WA have comprehensive mandatory frameworks

### What Australia Lacks

- **No mandatory AI security for private sector** (unlike EU AI Act)
- **No systematic risk classification** (EU has prohibited/high/limited/minimal)
- **No AI incident reporting regime** (despite SOCI cyber incident rules)
- **No foundation model governance** (EU has GPAI obligations)
- **No adversarial testing mandates** (EU requires for systemic risk models)
- **No consolidated AI Security body** (UK renamed theirs to AI *Security* Institute)

### The Safety â‰  Security Problem

Australia's National AI Plan establishes an AI Safety Institute focused on alignment and frontier risks. It does not address:

- Adversarial machine learning
- Model poisoning and data integrity
- AI supply chain security
- Red-teaming requirements
- Secure development lifecycle

The UK recognised this distinction and **renamed their AI Safety Institute to the AI Security Institute** in February 2025.

## How to Use This Resource

### For Compliance Teams
Start with the [Complete Inventory](docs/INVENTORY.md) to identify which frameworks apply to your organisation based on:
- Jurisdiction (federal/state)
- Sector (financial services, health, critical infrastructure, general)
- Obligation type (mandatory/voluntary)

### For Security Practitioners
The [Federal Frameworks](docs/FEDERAL.md) section details ACSC guidance with practical implementation notes.

### For Policy Analysts
The [Gap Analysis](docs/GAPS.md) and [International Comparison](docs/INTERNATIONAL.md) provide the evidence base for advocacy and submissions.

### For Researchers
The [Knowledge Graph](docs/KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md) visualises relationships.

## ISM AI Controls

The Information Security Manual contains three AI-specific controls (as of September 2025):

| Control | Requirement | Applicability |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **ISM-1923** | Mitigate risks identified in OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications | All LLM implementations |
| **ISM-1924** | Detect and mitigate adversarial inputs including prompt injection attempts | All AI systems accepting user input |
| **ISM-2072** | Store AI models in formats that do not allow arbitrary code execution (e.g., safetensors over pickle) | All AI model storage |
